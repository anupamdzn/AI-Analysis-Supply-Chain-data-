     - Mumbai → 15.32 days

4. **Which transportation mode is most cost-effective for delivering products?**  
   - 🚢 *Sea* transport is the most cost-efficient, followed by *Rail*, *Road*, and *Air* (most expensive).

5. **Which routes incur the highest and lowest transportation costs?**  
   - 📈 *Highest:* Route B → ₹595.66 (avg)  
   - 📉 *Lowest:* Route A → ₹485.48 (avg)

6. **How do production volumes vary across product types and locations?**  
   - 📊 A grouped bar chart was generated showing volume distributions across product types and locations, revealing significant location-based differences in production.

## 📌 Conclusion

This analysis highlights Cosmetics as the top revenue contributor and Sea transport as the most efficient mode. Delhi and Supplier 1 show strong lead time performance, while Route B incurs the highest logistics costs. There is minimal correlation between inventory levels and sales, suggesting the need for more nuanced demand forecasting. These findings help prioritize improvements in transportation, supplier selection, and product stocking strategies.
